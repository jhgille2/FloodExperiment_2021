## Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to test if the **N11-325** soybean genotype possesses flood tolerance. This will be a greenhouse experiment and the general strategy will be to compare the **N11-325** genotype to other genotypes which are already known to have or lack flood tolerance to determine if this new genotype possesses, or lacks flood tolerance traits.

## Experimental design

Five genotypes will be grown in flodded and non-flooded conditions in 8 replications within each environment. The genotypes are:

  - N11-352
  - Dunphy
  - Roy
  - Flood-Tolerant (From Tommy/Ben/Paul)
  - Flood-Susceptible (From Tommy/Ben/Paul)

Three seeds from each genotype will be planted for each replication x treatment combination. Thin these plants to one plant per pot after emergence. After plants have been thinned, transfer the pots to their treatment tanks as per the field book. Be sure to follow the plot order when putting them into the tanks as this is randomized and it will make it easier to find a plot if a label floats away or something like that.

Because there are 5 genotypes, and 8 reps of each genotype per treatment, each treatment has 40 plots (pots) in total. Pots are numbered 1-40 for each treatment. See the table below to see what this looks like for the first 5 entries for each condition.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
FB_TopTen <- tar_read(Fieldbook)$book %>% group_by(Flood_Condition) %>% top_n(5, 1/Plot) %>% ungroup()
FB_TopTen
```

Once plants have reached the V2 growth stage, (two unfurled trifoliates, see the image below), flood the two flood treatment tanks and continue watering the two non-flooded tanks as usual. Release flood conditions after seven days.

Take field visual ratings (see the field book).  

Take chlorophyll measurements **FIND PROCEDURE**.  

After about 2 weeks, or when the V5 stage is reached, collect the shoot and root from each pot. Take the wet biomass of shoot and root. **FIND PROCEDURE**.  

Root architecture measurements?  

Dry root and shoot for ten days at 60 degree C. 

**Find other variables related to flood tolerance**

## Data analysis

The objective of this experiment is to determine if N11-352 possesses flood-tolerance. The purpose of this section will be to define precisely what qualifies as "flood-tolerant" in terms of the variables that are measured in this study.   
The most important variables to consider are the biomass variables, both wet and dry, although root architecture will provide interesting meta-data to consider *why* the genotype may perform as it does. The general model for evaluating the performance of a genotype following some flood-tolerant relevant variable will be:  

$$y_{ijk} = \mu + F_i + R(F)_{ij} + G_k + GL_{ik} + \epsilon{ijk}$$  
Where $y_{ijk}$ is the response variable (ex. wet/dry biomass) for some plot, $F_i$ is the effect of environment $i$ (flooded or not flooded), $R(F)_{ij}$ is the effect of replication $j$ nested within flood treatment $i$, $G_k$ is the effect of genotype $G$, and $\epsilon_ijk$ is the residual error. Following this model, the significance of the main factors (genotype and flood condition) can be validated. In other words, we can check if the genotype and/or the environmental conditions had a significant influence on the variables relevant to flood tolerance. Following this check, we can then proceed to check if the performance of **N11-325** is at least as good as the drought tolerant variety.
