```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to test if the **N11-325** soybean genotype possesses flood tolerance. This will be a greenhouse experiment and the general strategy will be to compare the N11-325 genotype to other genotypes which are already known to have or lack flood tolerance to determine if this new genotype possesses, or lacks flood tolerance traits.

## Experimental design

Five genotypes will be grown in in 8 replications each in both flodded and non-flooded conditions. The genotypes are:

  - N11-352
  - Dunphy
  - Roy
  - Flood-Tolerant (From Tommy/Ben/Paul)
  - Flood-Susceptible (From Tommy/Ben/Paul)

Flooded and non-flooded environments will be made using 4 large tubs with two tubs flooded, and two tubs non-flooded as each tub can hold 20 pots.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
