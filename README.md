N11-352 Flood tolerance experiment
================

## Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to test if the **N11-325** soybean
genotype possesses flood tolerance. This will be a greenhouse experiment
and the general strategy will be to compare the N11-325 genotype to
other genotypes which are already known to have or lack flood tolerance
to determine if this new genotype possesses, or lacks flood tolerance
traits.

## Experimental design

Five genotypes will be grown in in 8 replications each in both flodded
and non-flooded conditions. The genotypes are:

-   N11-352
-   Dunphy
-   Roy
-   Flood-Tolerant (From Tommy/Ben/Paul)
-   Flood-Susceptible (From Tommy/Ben/Paul)

Flooded and non-flooded environments will be made using 4 large tubs
with two tubs flooded, and two tubs non-flooded as each tub can hold 20
pots.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
